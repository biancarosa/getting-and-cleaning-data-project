# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This my repository for the final project on Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## About the contents

### Script

There is only one script called run_analysis.R and it performs several operations on a dataset in order to make it tidy.
I strongly recommend you to set the working dir in the beginning of the script before trying to run it.

### Tidy data set

The file named tidy.txt represents the tidy dataset generated in the end of the script.

### CodeBook

For further info about the dataset, please check the [CodeBook](https://github.com/biancarosa/getting-and-cleaning-data-project/blob/master/CodeBook.md)
